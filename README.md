# README

This is a Rails app in which we build a fully database-backed resource.

Here's the plan:

1. We will use the RCAV Recipe to build our user interface.
4. We will use the `params` hash to receive user input.
2. We will use a SQLite Database file to hold all of our data.
3. We will use proper HTTP semantics so that our browser communicates propertly with our app.
4. We will adhere to the DRY principle so that our code is easy to understand and maintain.
5. We will adhere to the YAGNI principle so that our code is easy to understand and maintain.
